# chronox

A simple Rust utility to convert log files from local time to UTC ðŸ¦€.

It takes dates in `Month Day HH:MM:SS` format and converts it to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS Z` ISO8601 standard.

For example using a -06:00 offset:

```
Aug 27 00:00:00 host systemd[1]: Reloaded httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server.
```

Gets converted to:

```
2023-08-27 06:00:00 UTC host systemd[1]: Reloaded httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server.
```

# Usage

`chronox` can be used from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
chronox [logfile] [timezone offset]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The timezone offset from UTC needs to be in `-+00:00` format.
> For example `-06:00`.

A file with the suffix `-chronox` will be saved in the same directory as the original file.

# Downloading

# Gotchas

- The utility assumes the year is current year.
- Only files that use `Month Day HH:MM:SS` format would work (Like `messages` or `syslog`).
